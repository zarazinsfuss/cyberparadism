# Cyberparadism | Website

This is the offical web presence of the Cyberparadism aesthetic that formerly originated on the Aesthetics Wiki. Cyberparadism is an aesthetics that typically depicts lush and untamed nature, wherein a small-numbered breakaway civilization uses advanced, but reasonably possible technology for self-preservation up to the point of luxurious comfort that enables them to live in a paradise, hence the name. Common themes are resource-based economy, genetic life engineering, terraformation, exoplanets or similar tropes of space frontier exploration.

## Project Structure

The site is built using Hugo, a powerful and fast static site generator. The Cyberparadism website is structured as follows:

- `content/`: Contains all the markdown files which make up the content of the site. This includes most content such as blog posts and other written materials.
- `static/`: This directory hosts all static content like images, CSS files, SVG files.
- `layouts/`: Holds the HTML templates that define the structure of different types of pages on the site.
- `data/`: Stores configuration files and other data files used by the site.
- `themes/`: Contains the Hugo theme used for the site. Customizations to the theme are also located here. The website uses a fork of the [Blowfish theme](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish).
- `config/_default/*.toml`: The main configuration file for the Hugo site. This file contains global settings for the website.
